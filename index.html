	MISE is an academic enrichment program for students with a
	particular aptitude and enthusiasm for mathematics. We offer a
	variety of programs designed to identify, develop and connect
	talented young mathematicians. Our alumni have received recognition
	for their achievements, and have gone on to win prestigious
	scholarships to some of the worldâ€™s leading institutions and
	programs.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you are a parent or teacher of a very bright math student
	(grade 8-10), please sign up here to be notified when the
	application for the #MISE2023 becomes available. New schools
	and teachers may also register here to enable their students
	to participate in the program. As a non-profit organization,
	MISE has dedicated its work to advance the education of
	talented young mathematicians. This work is only possible
